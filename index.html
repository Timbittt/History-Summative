								<h2>What is peacekeeping?</h2>
								<p>Peacekeeping is one of the most effective ways of preventing conflict. It works by providing a neutral third party to enforce armistice, help protect civilians, rebuild, transition from war to peace, and prevent further conflict. Helping restore the rule of law, create a functioning government or organize elections are some other things peacekeepers undertake to stabilize war-torn countries. </p>

								<h2>Early Peacekeeping</h2>
								<p>The unprecedented destruction as the result of both world wars prompted people to realize that war was detrimental to all parties involved as well as the importance of preventing conflicts. This prompted the creation of the League of Nations with the  purpose of preventing conflict and later, its successor: The UN. The first peacekeeping missions took place when cold war rivalries resulted in instability and tumult. They consisted of unarmed troops charged with maintaining ceasefires, providing stability and supporting conflict resolution by political means. After the Cold War, peacekeepers became more involved and gained new responsibilities encompassing conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance, supporting rule of law, disarmament, and coordination with regional organizations.

								<h2>Peacekeeping today</h2>
								<p>and why canada isn't and shouldn't be a peacekeeping nation</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Canada is often considered a peacekeeping nation because of its great past contributions. <br />
This belief however, is outdated as Canadian support for peacekeeping has fallen: In the past Canada contributed over 80,000 peacekeepers to the UN, but today there are only 57 Canadians involved in UN peacekeeping missions (For additional context, India is currently providing 5.5k). Even when Canada was at the forefront of UN peacekeeping, later in the cold war, providing as many as 1,500 peacekeepers at a time, it had over 10,000 soldiers stationed at the German and French front with NATO to deal with any potential USSR aggression. <br />
One may think that not supporting peacekeeping more is an act of selfishness, but this couldnâ€™t be further from the truth: Thanks to many failed missions and scandals, Canada has decreased support in favor of other more helpful and effective action. Additionally, peacekeeping is no longer as effective thanks to the nature of conflict changing with terrorism, cyber threats, asymmetric warfare (eg. Russia - Ukraine, Israel - Palestine), now entering the scene.
Remembering Canada solely for peacekeeping forgets the sacrifices done during combat, counter-terrorism, and humanitarian operations. <br />
Even trying to rekindle peacekeeping would be unwise, as plenty of other countries are giving plenty of support and its national security interests best met by strategic partnerships, military operations, participation in international coalitions, or early conflict prevention. There are plenty of more serious issues ongoing such as climate change, poverty, environmental preservation, disease. <br />
In conclusion, peacekeeping is no longer an as effective way of preventing conflict and Canada should focus on dealing with other internal and external issues.
